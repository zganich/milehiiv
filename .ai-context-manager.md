# AI Context Window Management Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Context Window Monitoring

### Context Window Reset Triggers
- **50% Usage**: Start preparing for reset
- **60% Usage**: **MANDATORY** - Reset context window
- **65% Usage**: Emergency reset if missed at 60%

### Context Reset Protocol

#### When Context Hits 50%:
1. **Save Current Progress**: Update todos, save changes
2. **Prepare Reset Package**: Create summary of current work
3. **Document Next Steps**: List what needs to be done next
4. **Update Project Status**: Ensure knowledge base reflects current state

#### When Context Hits 60% (MANDATORY):
1. **Immediate Reset Required**: Stop current work
2. **Provide Reset Summary**: Brief overview of completed work
3. **Handoff Instructions**: Clear next steps for new context
4. **Update Memory**: Save critical information to memory

## 📋 Context Reset Checklist

### Before Reset (50-60% Usage):
- [ ] Save all file changes
- [ ] Update todo list with current status
- [ ] Update `.ai-knowledge-base.md` with progress
- [ ] Document any new discoveries or issues
- [ ] Create handoff summary for next session

### During Reset (60%+ Usage):
- [ ] Provide completion summary
- [ ] List remaining tasks
- [ ] Update memory with critical information
- [ ] Give clear next steps for continuation

### After Reset (New Context):
- [ ] Use `AI_INIT` command immediately
- [ ] Read updated knowledge base files
- [ ] Check project status
- [ ] Resume from documented next steps

## 🎯 Staying On Task Guidelines

### Focus Areas for MileHiiv:
1. **Configuration First**: Environment setup before development
2. **Database Setup**: Supabase connection before API implementation
3. **Authentication**: JWT setup before protected routes
4. **Core Features**: PDF processing, gap detection, trip management
5. **UI Implementation**: Dashboard and forms following "grandma test"

### Task Priority Order:
1. **High Priority**: Environment configuration, database setup
2. **Medium Priority**: Authentication, basic API endpoints
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced features, UI polish

### Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database connected and tested
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Basic API endpoints functional
- [ ] Core features implemented
- [ ] UI follows "grandma test" principles
