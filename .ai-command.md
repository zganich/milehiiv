# AI Command Reference

## SPECIAL COMMAND: `AI_INIT`

When you want me to properly initialize and check the project state, use this command:

```
AI_INIT
```

This command tells me to:
1. Read `.ai-knowledge-base.md` first
2. Check current project structure
3. Verify existing files and configuration
4. Only suggest what's actually missing
5. Build on existing work

## USAGE EXAMPLES:

**To get proper project status:**
```
AI_INIT - check project status
```

**To start development work:**
```
AI_INIT - ready to develop
```

**To troubleshoot issues:**
```
AI_INIT - help with setup
```

**To verify setup:**
```
AI_INIT - verify everything is ready
```

## WHAT AI_INIT DOES:

1. **Reads Knowledge Base**: Loads project context and current status
2. **Checks File Structure**: Verifies what files exist
3. **Reads Configuration**: Checks package.json, .env files, etc.
4. **Assesses Current State**: Determines what's actually needed
5. **Provides Accurate Status**: Reports what's done vs what's missing
6. **Suggests Next Steps**: Only what's actually required

## ALTERNATIVE COMMANDS:

**Quick Status Check:**
```
STATUS
```

**Force Fresh Start (if needed):**
```
FRESH_START
```

**Development Mode:**
```
DEV_MODE
```

## REMEMBER:
- Always use `AI_INIT` when starting a new session
- This ensures I read existing files before suggesting changes
- Prevents repeating completed setup work
- Maintains consistency across sessions
